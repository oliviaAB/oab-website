[moiraine](https://github.com/Plant-Food-Research-Open/moiraine) is a package for facilitating the construction of a reproducible analysis pipeline for multi-omics data integration. It provides functions to automate data import, pre-processing, transformation, integration through several tools, as well as interpretation and comparison of the integration results. It relies on the [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package to generate reproducible workflows.
