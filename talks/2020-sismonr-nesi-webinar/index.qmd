## Abstract

NeSIâ€™s next research spotlight webinar comes from Massey University PhD student Olivia Angelin-Bonnet. Olivia researches how to decipher genotype-phenotype interactions through regulatory networks using multi-omics data, and will speak about simulating gene regulatory networks, using R and Julia, to assess the performance of network inference reconstruction methods. Specifically, Olivia will explain to attendees:

-   What regulatory networks are and why/how they are reconstructed from biological data,
-   why simulations are valuable in systems biology,
-   how to link R and Julia, and
-   how using NeSI platforms and services was necessary for Olivia to take her research to the next level
