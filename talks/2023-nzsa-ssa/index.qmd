## Abstract

In this talk, I will be giving an overview of my role as a statistical scientist working in the fields of Systems Biology and multi-omics integration. In particular, I will discuss how being an applied data scientist is about much more than just fitting models. I will talk about how modern statistician and data science roles involve working with big and messy datasets, developing complex analysis pipelines, communicating results through reports and presentations, and implementing tools for disseminating our work. A number of principles and tools (e.g. data and code versioning, unit testing, workflow management systems) can support us through these activities to ensure our work is sustainable and reproducible. I will argue that mastering these principles is rapidly becoming a core competency for the modern statistical scientist.
