## Abstrat

NeSIâ€™s next research spotlight webinar comes from Massey University PhD student Olivia Angelin-Bonnet.  Olivia researches how to decipher genotype-phenotype interactions through regulatory networks using multi-omics data, and will speak about simulating gene regulatory networks, using R and Julia, to assess the performance of network inference reconstruction methods.  Specifically, Olivia will explain to attendees:

- What regulatory networks are and why/how they are reconstructed from biological data,
- why simulations are valuable in systems biology,
- how to link R and Julia, and
- how using NeSI platforms and services was necessary for Olivia to take her research to the next level
