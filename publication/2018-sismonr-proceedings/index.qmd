## Abstract

Cellular regulatory networks can be deciphered from multi-omics data using network inference methods. To assess the performance of such methods, one can use simulated data. To be insightful, the simulations must mimic the complexity of biological systems, including post-transcriptional regulation and genetic variations. Here we present our new simulation R package, sismonr, capable of generating gene expression profiles for complex in silico regulatory systems.
