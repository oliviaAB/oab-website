## Abstrat

### Updates in VIEWpoly: A visualization tool to integrate and explore polyploidy genetic analysis 

We will demonstrate an example of the usage of VIEWpoly, an R package, and a shiny app to mine results from MAPpoly, polymapR, QTLpoly, polyqtlR, and diaQTL. We will also show VIEWpoly new features such as its integration with HIDECAN package.

### Breeding values interactive dashboard

We will showcase an interactive dashboard, created in R, to display and explore breeding values from a (hypothetical) breeding program. This dashboard makes use of the Shiny capabilities to link plots and tables, in order to facilitate breeding decisions.
