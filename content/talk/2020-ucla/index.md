## Abstrat

The key information driving the development and fate
of cells and organisms is encoded in their DNA, and
processed through complex regulatory interactions
involving different molecular scales. In particular, the
production of mRNAs and proteins from genes is a
complex process, subject to tight regulation by other
gene products. Modelling such reg-ulatory networks
allows us to gain a better understanding of the
molecular processes gov-erning gene regulation, and
enables the simulation of experimental-like data in
order to test statistical tools used for the
reconstruction of these networks. In this talk we
highlight the challenges of building a realistic model
for gene regulatory networks, with an empha-sis on
the often overlooked post-transcriptional regulation.
We introduce our R package sismonr
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sismonr) for
generating gene regula-tory networks that include
different types of regulation, ranging from
transcription regu-lation to post-translational
modification, protein-coding as well as non-coding
genes, and simulating molecular profiles for
genetically diverse in silico individuals with
unrestricted ploidy.
