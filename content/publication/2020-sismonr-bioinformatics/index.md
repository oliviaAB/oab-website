## Abstract

We present sismonr, an R package for an integral generation and simulation of in silico biological systems. The package generates gene regulatory networks, which include protein-coding and non-coding genes along with different transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. The effect of genetic mutations on the system behaviour is accounted for via the simulation of genetically different in silico individuals. The ploidy of the system is not restricted to the usual haploid or diploid situations but can be defined by the user to higher ploidies. A choice of stochastic simulation algorithms allows us to simulate the expression profiles of the genes in the in silico system. We illustrate the use of sismonr by simulating the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation pathway for three genetically distinct in silico plants.
