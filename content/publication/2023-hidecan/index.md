## Abstract

**Summary:** We present hidecan, an R package for generating visualisations that summarise the results of one or more genome-wide association studies and differential expression analyses, as well as manually curated candidate genes, e.g. extracted from the literature.

**Availability and Implementation:** The hidecan package is implemented in R and is publicly available on the CRAN repository (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hidecan) and on GitHub (https://github.com/PlantandFoodResearch/hidecan). A description of the package, as well as a detailed tutorial are available at https://plantandfoodresearch.github.io/hidecan/.
