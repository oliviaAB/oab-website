## Abstract

*Yersinia enterocolitica* is a human pathogen transmitted via the faecal–oral route among animals and humans and is a major foodborne public health hazard. This study explores the role of *Y. enterocolitica* transmission at the livestock–wildlife interface and investigates the potential role wild and peridomestic rodents play as a source of this zoonotic pathogen. The total of 342 faecal samples collected from the seven rodent species and one insectivore was examined using an optimized protocol to culture and identify *Y. enterocolitica*. Positive samples were also bioserotyped for grouping and determination of sample pathogenicity. Wildlife species sampled in this study were separated into two sample groups: randomly sampled (brown rats, house mice, wood mice, bank voles, field voles and the common shrew), as well as targeted sampling (red and grey squirrels). The overall prevalence of *Y. enterocolitica* in the randomly sampled population was 3.73%. Brown rats were chosen as sentinel species and tested to determine if location (pig farm vs non-pig farm) was a significant factor affecting *Y. enterocolitica* prevalence. In this study, location was not significant. All positive samples were found to be of biotype 1A, deemed non-pathogenic. Three of the samples were serotype 09, six were serotype 27 and five had an unidentifiable serotype. This study represents the first time *Y. enterocolitica* has been identified in these species of wildlife within mainland Britain. In addition, this study's findings are entirely novel and overall with regard to field voles and common shrews. However, the role of wild and peridomestic rodents in the transmission of pathogenic *Y. enterocolitica* remains unknown, as this study was unable to detect the presence of pathogenic *Y. enterocolitica* strains in these species.
