  Hello there.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am French :fr:, currently living in New Zealand. I completed my PhD at Massey University, during which I worked on unraveling genotype-to-phenotype relationships in polyploid organisms, using multi-omics integration and causal inference. After my PhD, I became a Lecturer in Applied Statistics at Massey for a year and a half, before joining Plant and Food Research as a Statistical Scientist. I work on analysing biological datasets, mostly using R. I love learning about and using tools to make research more reproducible and shareable.

## Recent interests

 Here are some of the things and resources I've been interested in lately:
 
 - [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/index.html) by Patrick Mineault. Even though this is for Python users, it is full of best practices for writing research code that can directly be translated to R.
 
 - The amazing [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) R package, to construct reproducible workflows in R.
