  Hello there.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am French :fr:, currently living in New Zealand. I completed my PhD at Massey University, during which I worked on unraveling genotype-to-phenotype relationships in polyploid organisms, using multi-omics integration and causal inference. After my PhD, I became a Lecturer in Applied Statistics at Massey for a year and a half, before joining Plant and Food Research as a statistical scientist. I work on analysing biological datasets, mostly using R. I love learning about and using tools to make research more reproducible and shareable.
