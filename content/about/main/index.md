  Here are some of the things and resources I've been interested in lately:
  
  - The amazing [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) R package, to construct reproducible workflows in R.
  
  - [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) R package, to automatically build a website from your R package documentation.
  
  - [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/)'s content, especially about [building websites using bookdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFu_upDL2o).
  
  - The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.
